current sticking point - how to send msgs to robot which is prob. connected to wifi behind firewall

possibly this is done with udp over ssh  , it would be cool to use ipv6 too

App.py can run on the server  at 178.128.26.70   so there would be a car-control page there (as in json.html) 
 This needs to send udp msgs to settable addr of car
